The Sentiment Slider is a new way to have productive, difficult conversations. Writing a comment is hard, it requires confidence and conviction, but sliding is frictionless and simple.

#### Use
### Use

The Sentiment Slider uses two questions that then become the two axes of a familiar scatterplot. These questions could be written by the Globe Opinion writer or proposed by the editors, and we recommend assigning the questions as follows: though the two questions should be related to the Globe Opinion article, one should ask how the reader feels about the article, and the second should be about who they are.

We've found that a little personality goes a long way to encourage responses, and since the text fields are completely customizable writers have a new outlet for engaging with their readers.

- Backend: [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore?gclsrc=ds&gclsrc=ds&gclid=CN-X97Wl6vACFTMlrQYds88DQg), [Airtable](https://airtable.com/)
- Frontend: [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)

**Backend**

Firebase stores user clicks/coordinates by quiz. Airtable stores the question text and X- and Y-axis label texts.

Firebase and Airtable permissions:
- To access the Firebase database, contact alexjohnbeck@gmail.com and he will grant you owner access.
- To access the Airtable quiz questions, follow [this link.](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=inv0TeOAey0YnsHly&inviteToken=051582011191cdc9f51baf91747aa0df86552f81e1761b1b0a02570ce178ee20)

GatsbyJS handles the frontend and reads the Firebase data (specifically, a [Firestore collection](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore)) via [React's effect hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html) in src/components/slider.js.

Below, I've pasted the code from slider.js -- specifically, the section inside the React hook that pulls quiz clicks from Firebase. It is added to a `data` variable using the `setData()` method, which is then added to the HTML on the page:

```
quiz.orderBy('clickTime', 'desc').onSnapshot(    (querySnapshot) => {
      const graphData = []
      const clicks = []
      const allClicks = querySnapshot.size
      querySnapshot.forEach((doc) => {
        const clickId = doc.id
        const xAnswer = doc.data().x
        const yAnswer = doc.data().y
        const clickTime = doc.data().clickTime
        graphData.push([xAnswer, yAnswer])
        clicks.push(
          <div className='past-click' data-timestamp={clickTime} key={clickId}>
            <p>{xQuestion} <strong>{xAnswer}</strong></p>
            <p>{yQuestion} <strong>{yAnswer}</strong></p>
          </div>
        )
      })
      clicks.sort(function(a, b) {
        return b.props['data-timestamp'] - a.props['data-timestamp']
      })
      setData(
        // Quiz and scatterplot
      )
})
// Misc. code
return (
  <>
    {data}
  </>
)
```

**Frontend**

Gatsby is a React library that relies on components, pages, and templates.
- See src/components for most of the project's reusable parts -- the quiz, the scatterplot, etc.
- See src/pages for single pages we've built for presenting, mainly index.js
- See src/templates for the quiz template itself -- quiz.js serves 

#### Workflow Example
### Workflow Example

A Globe Opinion writer submits an article about student debt. The article itself debates the amount of money that should be forgiven if a relief fund becomes law. In the course of the article the writer describes their own education, the amount of debt they accumulated, and the story of how they paid it down, all to explain their opinion that the proposed law should forgive up to $30,000 of student debt.

Once the questions and axes are defined, that's the end of the writer's task. The rest is up to the respondents. As more and more responses accumulate on the scatterplot the potential increases for story discovery. Are their odd clusters of responses? Is the result what the writer expected?


#### Development
### Development

The Sentiment Slider leverages the 'range' input method built in HTML. This means that sliders are built into all browser environments and are adapted to whichever platform the reader uses.

### Testing & Discovery

Our user testing revealed 3 key insights:
1. Users are familiar with the standard range slider. They understand its granularity: they know what it means to not settle the slider on a specific answer. They know how to use it both on desktop and mobile, the Sentiment Slider does not require any additional training: users already know how it works.
